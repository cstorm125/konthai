Mythbusting the Stereotypical Thai People of USA

## Executive Summary

We use the `prop_df` dataset dervied from the US Census according to the `codebook` to perform proportional z-tests on characteristics of Thai population in the US and the general US population.

Note that we cherrypick only the most interesting features. Thus, this is might not be the most accurate way (p-value interpretation shenanigans aside) to prove or debunk these preconceptions about Thai people in the US and a lot of it will rely on the context; however, this is as close as aggregate numbers can take us. 

## Codebook
Contains the data manipulation in order to obtain the prop_df dataset used for proportional z-tests of characteristics between Thai people in the US and the general US population.
